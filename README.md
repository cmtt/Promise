Promise
-------

This is just another promise library, adapted from [briancavalier](https://github.com/briancavalier)'s
tiny promise (Gist)(https://gist.github.com/briancavalier/814318), by itself
a version of John Hann's [tiny promise](https://gist.github.com/unscriptable/814052).

It was extended with a Promise.all() function.
